What is printf?

printf(print formatted) in C, this writes out a cstring to stdout also known as standard output. In the most simple case, printf takes one argument: a string of characters to be printed. For example; one writes printf("xyz"). This sort of function would simply print an x, then a y, and finally a z. However, this is not exactly "formatted printing", but it is still the basis of what printf does.
